## Entropy analysis tools:

This folder is an appendix with the entropy analysis tools used in this research work.
[KenLM](https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/) and [SRILM](http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/) are used to calculate entropy from target data.
We do not provide an redistribution of SRILM due to licence restrictions, but you can download it through [this page.](http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/download.html)
Note that these tools need to be pre-installed before running entropy evaluation in this replication package.
